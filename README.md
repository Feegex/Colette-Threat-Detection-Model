# Colette-Threat-Detection-Model
Project Overview
The Colette Threat Detection Model is a binary classification model designed to identify potential threats based on a set of features. It uses a custom neural network with a Transformer-based architecture to analyze and predict whether a given input indicates a threat (1) or no threat (0). The model is trained on a synthetic dataset and includes comprehensive metrics to evaluate its performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC curve.

Features
Transformer-based neural network: Uses a custom Transformer block to learn complex feature relationships.
Early stopping and learning rate scheduling: To prevent overfitting and optimize training.
Performance metrics: Includes confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for thorough evaluation.
Visualization tools: Plots training history, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python installed with the following libraries:

TensorFlow: conda install tensorflow or pip install tensorflow
scikit-learn: conda install scikit-learn or pip install scikit-learn
NumPy: conda install numpy or pip install numpy
Matplotlib: conda install matplotlib or pip install matplotlib
Seaborn: conda install seaborn or pip install seaborn
You can install all dependencies at once by running:

Files
colette.py: The main script that contains the model, training process, evaluation, and visualizations.
custom_transformer.py: Contains the custom Transformer block used in the model architecture.
README.md: This documentation file.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colette-threat-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd colette-threat-detection
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the model: To train and evaluate the model, simply run: python colette.py

How It Works
1. Dataset Creation
The dataset is synthetically generated using scikit-learn's make_classification. It simulates a binary classification problem with 20 features, out of which 15 are informative for classification.

2. Data Preprocessing
Before training, the dataset is scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model. The data is then split into training and testing sets.

3. Transformer-Based Model
The model leverages a custom Transformer block that captures complex relationships between features through multi-head self-attention. It is followed by fully connected layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

4. Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize performance and prevent overfitting. After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to compute various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations such as the confusion matrix and ROC curve are also generated.

Usage
Training
To train the model, simply run the colette.py script. It will:
  Train the Transformer-based neural network on the training set.
  Display training and validation accuracy and loss.
  Automatically stop training if no improvement is seen for 5 epochs (early stopping).
  
Evaluation
The evaluation metrics are displayed after training, including:
  Accuracy on the test set.
  Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the performance of the model in terms of correct and incorrect predictions.
  Classification Report: Shows precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
  ROC Curve and AUC: Graphically displays the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate at different thresholds.

Making Predictions
You can make predictions on new data using the predict_threats function:
new_data = np.random.randn(5, 20)  # Example of new data
predictions = predict_threats(colette_transformer_model, new_data)
print(predictions)

Visualizations
The script generates several visualizations to help understand the model's performance:
  Training History: Plots accuracy and loss during training and validation.
  Confusion Matrix: Provides a heatmap showing the number of true/false positives and negatives.
  ROC Curve: Displays the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, along with the AUC score.

Future Work
Real-world data: The next step would be to apply this model to real-world threat detection datasets.
Model Optimization: Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to further improve performance.
Deployment: Package the model for deployment using a REST API for real-time threat detection.
